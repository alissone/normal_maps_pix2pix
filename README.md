# Converting images into normal maps with pix2pix CNNs

This repository contains a simple case study to generate normal maps from color images without depth information (or any other information whatsoever).
The results are reasonable as a proof of concept that a CNN is able to store a certain level of representation of a tridimentional space inside its latent space.
